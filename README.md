### Introduction

The Peter Moss Acute Myeloid & Lymphoblastic Leukemia Drug Discovery repository is collection of research and development projects for AML & ALL drug discovery. These projects use various methods of Artificial Intelligence to identify possible candidates for drugs to help combat Acute Myeloid & Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.

This area of the project is headed by [Ho Leung Ng](https://www.leukemiaresearchfoundation.ai/team/ho-leung-ng/profile "Ho  Leung Ng") - Kansas State University, Dept. Biochemistry & Molecular Biophysics & Intel Software Innovator.

# About The AML Drug Discovery Problem

Most current cancer drug research is on the discovery of targeted drugs. Targeted drugs are usually designed to block (in most cases) or activate a specific target protein. The targets are proteins that are either mutated or over expressed in the cancer relative to normal cells. Targeted drugs are usually less toxic than cytotoxic drugs. If the proper target for a cancer is identified, targeted drugs can be extremely effective.

Much research is required to properly identify potential targets for each subtype of cancer. For AML, the different subtypes are usually associated with distinct sets of targets. A good starting point to learn about AML targets is the Tyner et al paper published in 2018 in Nature v562, 526. Once a target is identified, researchers usually experimentally screen thousands of compounds to identify those that are active in an approach called high-throughput screening. This is too costly for all but drug companies and a few highly resourced academic labs. Alternatively, if the 3D structure of the target protein is known, one can computationally screen compounds by calculating their chemical fit to the binding site. The highest scoring compounds are tested experimentally. One can apply ML methods and develop new ways of scoring compounds.

## Potential Research Projects

Potential research projects for the Peter Moss Acute Myeloid/Lymphoblastic Leukemia Drug Discovery Research & Development

1. Discovery of anthracyclines that are predicted to be less cardiotoxic.
2. Discovery of anthracyclines that are predicted to be less associated with drug resistance.
3. Identify new AML targets from the Tyner et al paper, especially those which have only been lightly
   studied. Find molecules to block these targets.
4. Choose immunomodulatory targets such as STING. Identify new bioactive molecules for these targets.
5. Develop models that can predict cardiotoxicity based on chemical structure of drugs.

# ORGANIC (Objective-Reinforced Generative Adversarial Network for Inverse-design Chemistry)

The team is very excited that we have been granted permission from Alan Aspuru-Guzik, formerly Professor at Harvard University, Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology and now at the University of Toronto, to integrate code based on ORGANIC (Objective-Reinforced Generative Adversarial Network for Inverse-design Chemistry) into the Peter Moss Acute Myeloid/Lymphoblastic Leukemia AI Research Project.

Big thank you to ORGANIC & Ho Leung Ng who has made this possible. The team are very grateful for this opportunity! We will be using this research and code as a foundation for our drug discovery project that will ultimately be trained to find possible candidates for new drugs to battle Acute Myeloid/Lymphoblastic Leukemia.

__ORGANIC (Objective-Reinforced Generative Adversarial Network for Inverse-design Chemistry) is an efficient molecular generation tool, able to create molecules with desired properties. It has a user-oriented interface, and doesn't require a HPC cluster. Feel free to check our article about ORGANIC and/or contact the developers if you have any issue or are interested in collaborations.__
